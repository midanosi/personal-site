<span>TODO: make this a blog post</span>

<h1>Time off in 2023</h1>
<h2>Why the time off this year?</h2>
<p>
	A few reasons!
    1. an itch to travel
    2. a break from programming
	3. and just a chance to be idle
    4. (mental health)
</p>

<h2>What have I got up to?</h2>

<h3>Travel</h3>
I knew going in that I wanted to try backpacking for the first time, but I also didn't feel like being
away for a long time in one go. So I travelled to nearby european countries that I've never visited for,
and went only for a couple weeks at a time. And this worked for me!
<p>
	A longer than usual trip to the alps, where I was able to both go skiing, and learn to snowboard
	for the first time!
</p>
<p>My first backpacking trip, which I spent in northern Italy</p>
<p>A second backpacking trip across Scandinavia</p>
<p>A holiday in Crete</p>
<p>2 Stag Do's and 4 Weddings throughout this summer</p>
<p>and a few long weekends to visit friends and family across the country</p>
<ul>
    <li>telford, hiking</li>
    <li>bristol, triathlon</li>
    <li>edinburgh, half</li>
    <li>bath and bristol</li>
    <li>southampton</li>
    <li>friend visiting me</li>
</ul>

<h3>Projects</h3>
<ul>
    <li>scratch the 3D itch with Threlte, contributed to docs</li>
    <li>spyro things
        <ul>
            <li>R3F spyro portal scene (using {`<Portal />`})</li>
            <li>downloaded actual models from game</li>
            <li>used blender and pmndrs tools to import into web scenes</li>
            <li>intro flying in scene</li>
            <li>loaded artisans model and used rapier physics to make a shit version of the game</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

</ul>

<h3>
    Cooking
</h3>
<p>Did way more, got lots better and more confident</p>
<p>Explored ways to channel that learning into a recipe site/encyclopedia-like resource for myself</p>

<h3>Volunteering</h3>
<p>
	Genuinely had never volunteered in my life before, so beginning to spend some of my time doing
	delivery and kitchen shifts with (link)CCK has been a brilliant experience
</p>

<h3>Downsides</h3>
<p>
	1. lack of daily structure (requires greater discipline on my part)
    2. maintaining interest in side-projects is hard when you are not collaborating or sharing it with
	anyone. The easiest bit of work I did this entire time was contributing to the Threlte docs,
	because I was getting immediate and positive feedback, which drove me to continue when I know I
	absolutely wouldn't have otherwise
    3. bye bye money
</p>

<p>
	I don't write this post to brag about my ability to do this. I know that even having this choice
	comes from a place of large privilege I write it more to save it for myself to read again in the
	future, and maybe easily describe what I got up in this year quickly, without having to tell the
	same story every time I am asked! On the whole, this time off work has well hit the goals I had of
	it when I began, and I wholly recommend doing the same if you are in financially stable position
	to do so, and have the itch.
